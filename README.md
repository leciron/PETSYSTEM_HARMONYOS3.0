# Parent-Child Pet Interaction System Based on HarmonyOS 3.0 Distributed Features

## Introduction
The Parent-Child Pet Interaction System is a multi-scenario interaction system developed in TypeScript using HarmonyOS 3.0. It leverages distributed features for seamless device synchronization, providing an immersive and interactive experience for parents and children.

### Three live sceneries
#### 1. Feed the pet
- Choose your favorite pet image and check if the food is past its expiration date.
- Wash hands before meals. When feeding, the pet will respond with various reactions, incluing emotion, words, thoughts.
